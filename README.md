# HEV Cruise Control Simulation 🚗⚡

This project simulates a **Hybrid Electric Vehicle (HEV) Cruise Control System** using concepts from **Digital & Control Systems**.  
It demonstrates how control theory and feedback mechanisms can be applied to maintain vehicle speed under varying road and load conditions.

---

## 📌 Features
- Implements **cruise control algorithm** for HEVs  
- Uses **control system models** (feedback + plant dynamics)  
- Demonstrates **speed regulation** under disturbances  
- Modular and extendable simulation code  

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Programming Language:** Python  
- **Libraries:** NumPy, Matplotlib, Control Systems Library (`control`)  
- **Concepts Used:** Digital Control, System Modeling, Feedback Control
